# Dawg-Tickets

The University of Georgia Athletic Association (UGAAA) would like to create a web application that allows students to trade and transfer game tickets between each other. This UGA Ticket Trading Web Application will enable users to exchange tickets for UGA sporting events, such as football, basketball, gymnastics, without money transactions. This application will focus strictly on trading and transferring, not selling, allowing users to swap tickets they already own for those to other events or seats, ensuring fairness and compliance with university policies. 

From this platform, users will be able to post tickets available for trade, search for others seeking trades, and securely connect through a verified account system (SSO). Users may also simply transfer tickets one way to their account of choice (similar to the current donation system, but with the additional option of selecting which peer receives the ticket)
